    <p>At the beginning of your college career, you no doubt are filled with a bunch of questions and not very many answers. Curiosity about what your life will be like in and out of school, and being even somewhat tangential to the technology sphere means that you have no doubt become aware of Generative AI, and I‚Äôd wager have many questions, concerns, and ideas.</p>

    <p>Whether you‚Äôre just stepping into your first computing class or you‚Äôve already dabbled in code, one thing is clear: AI is going to be a part of your journey. A big part.</p>

    <p>This guide is here to help you navigate that. Not as a lecture, and not as a warning, but as a toolkit. Whether you‚Äôre curious about what AI can do, cautious about its role in education, or just looking for ways to make your study sessions a little more productive and tailored, this guide is built for you.</p>

    <p><strong>Our goal here is simple:</strong></p>

    <p>I want to show you how to work with AI, not for it, and not have it work for you blindly, but using it as a powerful assistant, while still keeping your own skills sharp and your learning front and center. You are still in the driver‚Äôs seat.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>What AI actually is (beyond the hype),</li>
        <li>How it‚Äôs already being used in computing,</li>
        <li>The ethical questions you‚Äôll want to consider,</li>
        <li>Practical ways to include AI in how you work,</li>
        <li>Tools you can start using today (and how),</li>
        <li>A note about the future</li>
        <li>A takeaway from this guide</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To make this guide more personal, we‚Äôll ask you a few quick questions as you go. Your answers will help tailor the experience to your goals.</p>

        </div>

        <p>Let‚Äôs start with the basics.</p>

        <p>Artificial Intelligence isn‚Äôt actually brand new, it‚Äôs been quietly working behind the scenes in things like search engines, recommendation systems, and voice assistants for years. But you‚Äôre probably thinking, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not the AI everyone‚Äôs talking about now,‚Äù and you‚Äôre right.</p>

        <p>The big shift is with Generative AI. Unlike older systems that mostly recognized patterns, this kind of AI can create new things, text, images, code, music, and more. That means tasks we used to think were uniquely human, like writing, designing, or composing, can now be (at least partially) done by machines.</p>

        <p>For some, that‚Äôs exciting. For others, unsettling. Either way, it‚Äôs a big change. AI is now shaping how we work, learn, and even think, and staying curious, critical, and open to learning will help you navigate it.</p>

        

        <button class="button is-success mt-4" onclick="nextSection('faces-of-ai')">Next</button>
    </section>




    <!-- Faces of AI Section -->
    <section id="faces-of-ai" class="container content">
        <h2 class="title">The Many Faces of AI in Computing</h2>
        <div class="field is-grouped is-align-items-center">
            <button class="button is-link is-small" onclick="playSectionById('faces-of-ai', this)">üîä Listen</button>
            <span class="ml-3 has-text-grey" id="ttsStatus-faces-of-ai" style="font-size: 0.9em;"></span>
        </div>

        <p>Whether you realize it or not, Generative AI has already become deeply woven into many of the tools and platforms you use every day. From chatbots on retail websites to the AI-generated summaries now appearing at the top of Google searches (a result of its own LLM, Gemini), this technology is no longer something you have to seek out, it‚Äôs baked into the digital spaces you already navigate.</p>
        <p>This quiet integration means that AI is influencing how we search for information, interact with services, and even make decisions, often without us fully noticing. As this technology becomes more embedded in everything from search engines to productivity software, it‚Äôs important to recognize both its potential and its limitations. While it can speed things up or offer new ways to approach a task, it also shapes what we see, how we solve problems, and which voices get amplified.</p>
        <p>In computing specifically, AI shows up in a range of roles, not just as a flashy tool for generating text or images, but as something that can impact how we code, debug, research, and even learn. It‚Äôs becoming a common layer across tools students and developers rely on. That makes it all the more important to not only learn how to use AI effectively, but to critically engage with how it works, what assumptions it carries, and when to question its output.</p>
        <p>As AI becomes more embedded in everyday tech, it‚Äôs no longer just a specialized tool for experts, it‚Äôs something students, creatives, and developers are already expected to navigate. Whether you‚Äôre aware of it or not, you‚Äôre entering an academic and professional world where knowing how to work with AI is becoming just as important as knowing how to work without it.</p>

        <p>So what does that actually look like in practice?</p>
        <p>Here are a few ways you might start to interact with AI in your daily work and some things to keep in mind as you do:</p>

        <div class="has-text-centered">
          <img id="aiImageFaces" src="/assets/img/loading.gif" alt="AI Concept Image"
            style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px; height: auto; object-fit: cover; object-position: center;">
        </div>

        <h3 class="subtitle">AI in Debugging</h3>
        <p>If you‚Äôve ever found yourself staring at an error message for way too long, you‚Äôre definitely not alone. AI tools can be surprisingly helpful here, they can explain what an error might mean, walk you through possible fixes, or even suggest what to try next. That said, they‚Äôre not perfect. They won‚Äôt replace your own understanding, and sometimes they can send you in the wrong direction. What I‚Äôve found is that they‚Äôre most helpful when you give them context, show them what you‚Äôre working with, explain what you‚Äôre trying to do, and walk through your thought process. The more information you provide, the more useful and accurate their suggestions tend to be. Treat them as a partner in your debugging, not a shortcut.</p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">AI as a Brainstorming Assistant</h3>
        <p>At the start of a project, when you‚Äôre staring at a blank page or screen, AI can be a good way to break through the block. Whether you‚Äôre outlining a paper, planning a project, or just trying to get your thoughts in order, it‚Äôs helpful to have something to bounce ideas off of, and that‚Äôs where AI can shine. It might throw out ideas you hadn‚Äôt thought of or help you see your problem from a different angle. Just keep in mind that a lot of its suggestions tend to be safe or familiar. If you‚Äôre aiming for something original, you‚Äôll still need to dig deeper. Think of AI more like a conversation partner, sometimes, just hearing an idea out loud (even if it‚Äôs a bit off) can help you get to something better.</p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">AI in Code Generation</h3>
        <p>AI can be a real time-saver when it comes to generating code, especially for repetitive or boilerplate-heavy tasks. Tools like Copilot, ChatGPT, or Claude can fill in functions, suggest syntax, or help you scaffold larger pieces of code. But here‚Äôs the catch: just because the code runs doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs correct or that you understand what it‚Äôs doing. It‚Äôs really important to read through and test everything it gives you. Use these tools to help you work faster, not to skip the learning part. They can be great for understanding unfamiliar code or getting unstuck, but don‚Äôt let them become a crutch. A good programmer can become a great one with AI as a support, but if you don‚Äôt understand the fundamentals, the tool won‚Äôt bridge that gap for you.</p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">AI in Research</h3>
        <p>When you‚Äôre starting a research project and feeling overwhelmed, AI can help you get your bearings. It‚Äôs useful for summarizing long texts, drafting rough outlines, or even surfacing potential topics or questions. That said, be careful. AI doesn‚Äôt always get things right, it can misrepresent ideas, cite outdated info, or even invent sources that sound real but aren‚Äôt. Some models now include links to actual sources, which is a step forward, but don‚Äôt take anything at face value. Always double-check the information, especially citations. Think of AI as a way to speed up the ‚Äúgetting started‚Äù phase, it can give you a solid launchpad, but the deeper research and critical thinking still have to come from you.</p>
        <br>
        <p>From the examples above, or even on your own how are you using AI?</p>

      <p>As AI becomes more embedded in the tools and workflows we use every day, it's natural that people will have different feelings about it. Some are excited about the possibilities. Others are curious but cautious. Some are skeptical, scared, frustrated, or prefer to avoid it altogether. No feeling is wrong, each reflects a different approach to AI, and all are valid.</p>

      <p>In this section, the goal isn‚Äôt to convince you to feel a certain way. It‚Äôs to validate wherever you're starting from and offer guidance on how you might work thoughtfully with AI, no matter your stance.</p>

      </div>
      <p>As AI becomes a bigger part of your academic and professional life, knowing how to use it responsibly isn‚Äôt just good practice, it‚Äôs essential.
        Using AI well isn‚Äôt about letting it do all the work for you. It‚Äôs about treating it like a tool: helpful, powerful, but always requiring your oversight.</p>
      <p>Here are a few best practices to keep in mind as you start working with AI more intentionally:</p>

      <h3>1. Check Outputs, Don‚Äôt Blindly Trust</h3>
      <p><strong>AI often sounds confident, even when it‚Äôs wrong.</strong></p>
      <p>Whether you‚Äôre getting a code suggestion, a research summary, or a brainstormed list of ideas, always review what it gives you critically. Ask yourself:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Does this actually make sense?</li>
        <li>Can I verify it with another source?</li>
        <li>Is there a chance this could be outdated, biased, or just incorrect?</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Trust, but verify.</strong> Think of AI outputs as a first draft, not a finished product.</p>

      <h3>2. Understand Its Limits</h3>
      <p>AI can do a lot, but it has hard limits. It doesn‚Äôt "know" things the way people do. It generates patterns based on training data, not real-world understanding. That means:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>It can make up fake facts ("hallucinations").</li>
        <li>It can miss nuance or context that a human would catch.</li>
        <li>It doesn't truly understand ethics, logic, or emotion, it mimics them.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Knowing what AI can‚Äôt do is just as important as knowing what it can.</p>

      <h3>3. Maintain Academic Integrity</h3>
      <p>Using AI ethically means being transparent about when and how you use it.
 You wouldn't copy a friend's essay and claim it was yours, the same goes for AI.Some basics:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Don‚Äôt submit AI-generated work without understanding it, you‚Äôre responsible for what you turn in.</li>
        <li>When in doubt, disclose your use. (Example: "I used ChatGPT to brainstorm initial ideas for this paper.")</li>
        <li>Follow your institution‚Äôs AI policies, different professors and departments may have different rules about acceptable use.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Using AI responsibly shows integrity and protects your own learning.</p>

      <h3>4. The More You Give It, The More It Gives You</h3>
      <p>When working with AI, how you ask matters.The more background, examples, and goals you provide, the better the responses you‚Äôll get.
        Compare:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>‚ùå "Help me write this paper."</li>
        <li>‚úÖ "I‚Äôm writing a 3-page analysis on the ethics of AI in education. Can you suggest 3 angles I could take, focusing on real-world examples?"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Be specific. Be clear. Treat AI like a teammate you have to brief carefully. Good inputs lead to useful outputs.</p>

      <h3>5. Credit AI Like You Would a Source or Teammate</h3>
      <p>If you used an AI tool to assist with your work, even just for brainstorming, it‚Äôs good practice to acknowledge it. Depending on your context, that could mean:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A footnote in a paper ("Draft outline generated using ChatGPT, revised and expanded by the author.")</li>
        <li>A comment in your code ("Function scaffold suggested by GitHub Copilot, optimized and documented by me.")</li>
        <li>A quick note to your instructor or team.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Citing AI use doesn‚Äôt make you look lazy, it shows you‚Äôre being honest and responsible about your process.</p>

      <h3>6. Stay Involved in the Process</h3>
      <p>AI can suggest, summarize, and speed things up, but you should always stay the active participant. Your role is to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Decide what to keep or discard.</li>
        <li>Add your own voice, thinking, and analysis.</li>
        <li>Make sure the final product truly reflects your understanding.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Think of AI like an idea generator or assistant. It can help expand your thinking, but it can‚Äôt replace your thinking. You‚Äôre still the author, the coder, the researcher, the creator.</p>

      <br>
      <p><strong>Learning how to work with AI responsibly takes practice.</strong></p>
      <p> But the habits you build now, verifying information, staying transparent, thinking critically, are the same habits that will make you a stronger student, developer, and professional in the long run.</p>
      <p>At the end of the day, AI is a tool. You are the mind behind the work.</p>

      <p>When you hear about AI, it‚Äôs easy to picture a big, complicated system you‚Äôll only encounter in a research lab or corporate tech stack. But the truth is, AI tools are already part of the everyday workflow for many students, developers, researchers, and creatives, often in surprisingly accessible ways.</p>

      <p>Instead of thinking of AI as one giant thing you need to master, it‚Äôs more helpful to think about what you actually want to improve first. Different AI tools are good for different goals: helping you debug code, brainstorm ideas, organize research, or stay more productive.</p>

      <p>The key isn‚Äôt to chase every shiny new app, it‚Äôs to find targeted, reliable tools that can support your learning and work, while still keeping you in the driver‚Äôs seat.</p>

      <p>In this section, we‚Äôll walk through a few common areas where AI can be practically useful for students, with examples of specific tools to explore if you‚Äôre interested.</p>

      <hr>

      <h3 class="subtitle">Using AI for Coding Help</h3>
      <p>For many students in computing and engineering, the first major use of AI is as a coding assistant. Tools like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and Replit Ghostwriter can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Suggest code snippets based on comments or patterns.</li>
        <li>Help debug errors when you're stuck.</li>
        <li>Scaffold basic functions or templates to get you moving faster.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When used carefully, these tools can speed up your development process, help you learn new languages or frameworks, and even make solo projects more manageable. Just remember: the goal is to understand what you‚Äôre building, not just paste what the AI suggests. If you ever find yourself accepting code you don‚Äôt fully understand, that‚Äôs a good signal to slow down and dig deeper.</p>

      <hr>

      <h3 class="subtitle">Using AI for Study Tools</h3>
      <p>Keeping up with multiple classes, assignments, and exams can get overwhelming fast. AI-powered study tools can help lighten the mental load by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Generating flashcards from your notes (Quizlet AI).</li>
        <li>Helping explain tricky homework questions (Socratic).</li>
        <li>Organizing study schedules or creating mock quizzes (ChatGPT custom prompts).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These tools don‚Äôt replace studying, but they can streamline how you prepare, helping you focus your energy where it‚Äôs most needed. And again, it‚Äôs important to verify: AI-generated study materials sometimes oversimplify or miss nuance, especially in complex subjects.</p>

      <hr>

      <h3 class="subtitle">Using AI for Brainstorming and Creative Work</h3>
      <p>Whether you're writing an essay, designing an app, or planning a group project, getting started is often the hardest part. This is where AI can really shine:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Brainstorming possible angles for a paper or presentation.</li>
        <li>Outlining project ideas.</li>
        <li>Suggesting creative approaches you hadn‚Äôt considered.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or specialized writing tools like Notion AI and Sudowrite can act like a thought partner, someone to bounce early ideas off of without the pressure of needing perfection. The important thing to remember is that AI is good at sparking ideas, but the real creativity, analysis, and critical thinking still have to come from you.</p>

      <hr>

      <h3 class="subtitle">Using AI for Research Support</h3>
      <p>Starting a big research project can feel like standing at the edge of a giant maze. AI tools like Elicit, Consensus, and Scite can help you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Find relevant academic papers.</li>
        <li>Summarize large bodies of research quickly.</li>
        <li>See how different studies connect and evolve over time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Used well, these tools can shorten the time it takes to get oriented on a topic and make it easier to spot promising directions for deeper research. But like with all AI outputs: don't take summaries at face value. Always check sources directly, especially if you're using information in academic work.</p>

      <hr>

      <h3 class="subtitle">Using AI for Organization and Productivity</h3>
      <p>Not every use of AI has to be flashy. Sometimes the most powerful thing AI can do for you is make it easier to manage your time and energy. Tools like Notion AI, Trello AI assistants, and even structured ChatGPT prompts can help:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Break down large assignments into smaller, manageable steps.</li>
        <li>Build checklists or timelines for long-term projects.</li>
        <li>Prioritize tasks when everything feels overwhelming.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Used thoughtfully, AI can help you stay more focused and strategic, without feeling like you‚Äôre constantly scrambling.</p>

      <br><br>
      <p>The bottom line:</p>
      <p><strong> AI isn‚Äôt here to replace your skills, it‚Äôs here to assist them.</strong></p>
      <p> By choosing tools thoughtfully, setting clear goals, and staying critical about what AI suggests, you can build a workflow that‚Äôs not just faster, but smarter.</p>
      <p>You don‚Äôt need to use everything. Start with one or two tools that match your real needs, and grow from there.</p>

        </div>

      <h3>Staying Adaptable in an AI-Driven World</h3>

      <p>The truth is, nobody knows exactly what every job will look like in 5 or 10 years. Some roles will transform. Some new roles will emerge that don't even exist yet. Some old roles will require new ways of thinking.</p>

      <p>That can feel intimidating, and honestly, it is intimidating sometimes. It‚Äôs okay to feel overwhelmed or uncertain. Most of us are right there with you.</p>

      <p>But the students and professionals who will thrive aren't necessarily the ones who know everything right now. They‚Äôre the ones who:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Stay curious.</li>
        <li>Stay flexible.</li>
        <li>Keep learning and re-learning as the landscape shifts.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The best thing you can do for your future isn‚Äôt to try to predict exactly how AI will change your field, it‚Äôs to build the habits of resilience and learning that will let you keep growing, no matter what changes come.</p>

      <h3 class="subtitle">Quick Reflection</h3>
      <p><strong>What role do you think AI might play in your future career?</strong></p>

      <hr>


      <p>The future isn‚Äôt about becoming a machine or fighting against change. It‚Äôs about learning to work with new tools thoughtfully, asking good questions, and bringing your own creativity and judgment into every project you do.</p>

      <p><strong>Your ability to adapt, not just your ability to memorize, is what will keep you valuable, fulfilled, and excited about the work you‚Äôre doing.</strong></p>

      <p>And you don‚Äôt have to figure it all out today. Start with small steps. Stay curious. Keep moving.</p>
